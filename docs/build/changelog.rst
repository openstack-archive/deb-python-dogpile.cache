.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.3
    :released: Wed Jan 8 2014

    .. change::
        :tags: bug
        :pullreq: 10

      Fixed bug where the key_mangler would get in the way of usage of the
      async_creation_runner feature within the :meth:`.Region.get_or_create`
      method, by sending in the mangled key instead of the original key.  The
      "mangled" key is only supposed to be exposed within the backend storage,
      not the creation function which sends the key back into the :meth:`.Region.set`,
      which does the mangling itself.  Pull request courtesy Ryan Kolak.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k

      Fixed bug where the :meth:`.Region.get_multi` method wasn't calling
      the backend correctly in Py3K (e.g. was passing a destructive ``map()``
      object) which would cause this method to fail on the memcached backend.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 55

      Added a ``get()`` method to complement the ``set()``, ``invalidate()``
      and ``refresh()`` methods established on functions decorated by
      :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_on_arguments` and
      :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_multi_on_arguments`.  Pullreq courtesy
      Eric Hanchrow.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 51
        :pullreq: 11

      Added a new variant on :class:`.MemoryBackend`, :class:`.MemoryPickleBackend`.
      This backend applies ``pickle.dumps()`` and ``pickle.loads()`` to cached
      values upon set and get, so that similar copy-on-cache behavior as that
      of other backends is employed, guarding cached values against subsequent
      in-memory state changes.  Pullreq courtesy Jonathan Vanasco.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug
        :pullreq: 9

      Fixed a format call in the redis backend which would otherwise fail
      on Python 2.6; courtesy Jeff Dairiki.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.2
    :released: Fri Nov 15 2013

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      Fixes to routines on Windows, including that default unit tests pass,
      and an adjustment to the "soft expiration" feature to ensure the
      expiration works given windows time.time() behavior.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      Added py2.6 compatibility for unsupported ``total_seconds()`` call
      in region.py

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 44

      Added a new argument ``lock_factory`` to the :class:`.DBMBackend`
      implementation.  This allows for drop-in replacement of the default
      :class:`.FileLock` backend, which builds on ``os.flock()`` and only
      supports Unix platforms.  A new abstract base :class:`.AbstractFileLock`
      has been added to provide a common base for custom lock implementations.
      The documentation points to an example thread-based rw lock which is
      now tested on Windows.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.1
    :released: Thu Oct 10 2013

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 38

      The :meth:`.CacheRegion.invalidate` method now supports an option
      ``hard=True|False``.  A "hard" invalidation, equivalent to the
      existing functionality of :meth:`.CacheRegion.invalidate`, means
      :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_or_create` will not return the "old" value at
      all, forcing all getters to regenerate or wait for a regeneration.
      "soft" invalidation means that getters can continue to return the
      old value until a new one is generated.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 40

      New dogpile-specific exception classes have been added, so that
      issues like "region already configured", "region unconfigured",
      raise dogpile-specific exceptions.  Other exception classes have
      been made more specific.  Also added new accessor
      :attr:`.CacheRegion.is_configured`. Pullreq courtesy Morgan Fainberg.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      Erroneously missed when the same change was made for ``set()``
      in 0.5.0, the Redis backend now uses ``pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL``
      for the ``set_multi()`` method as well when producing pickles.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, redis, py3k
        :tickets: 39

      Fixed an errant ``u''`` causing incompatibility in Python3.2
      in the Redis backend, courtesy Jimmey Mabey.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      The :func:`.util.coerce_string_conf` method now correctly coerces
      negative integers and those with a leading + sign. This previously
      prevented configuring a :class:`.CacheRegion` with an ``expiration_time``
      of ``'-1'``. Courtesy David Beitey.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      The ``refresh()`` method on :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_multi_on_arguments`
      now supports the ``asdict`` flag.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.0

      producing pickles.  Courtesy Lx Yu.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_on_arguments` now has a new argument
      ``to_str``, defaults to ``str()``.  Can be replaced with ``unicode()``
      or other functions to support caching of functions that
      accept non-unicode arguments.  Initial patch courtesy Lx Yu.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      Now using the ``Lock`` included with the Python
      ``redis`` backend, which adds ``lock_timeout``
      and ``lock_sleep`` arguments to the :class:`.RedisBackend`.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 33, 35

      Added new methods :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_or_create_multi`
      and :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_multi_on_arguments`, which
      make use of the :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_multi` and similar
      functions to store and retrieve multiple keys at once while
      maintaining dogpile semantics for each.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :tickets: 36

      Added a method ``refresh()`` to functions decorated by
      :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_on_arguments` and
      :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_multi_on_arguments`, to complement
      ``invalidate()`` and ``set()``.

      :meth:`.CacheRegion.configure` accepts an
      optional ``datetime.timedelta`` object
      for the ``expiration_time`` argument as well
      as an integer, courtesy Jack Lutz.

      Added support for simple augmentation of existing
      backends using the :class:`.ProxyBackend` class.
      Thanks to Tim Hanus for the great effort with
      development, testing, and documentation.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :pullreq: 14

      Full support for multivalue get/set/delete
      added, using :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_multi`,

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      Added support for the ``cache_timeout`` Mako
      argument to the Mako plugin, which will pass
      the value to the ``expiration_time`` argument
      of :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_or_create`.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :pullreq: 13

      :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_or_create` and
      :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_on_arguments` now accept a new
      argument ``should_cache_fn``, receives the value
      returned by the "creator" and then returns True or
      False, where True means "cache plus return",
      False means "return the value but don't cache it."

    :released: Sat Jan 19 2013

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :pullreq: 10

      An "async creator" function can be specified to
      :class:`.CacheRegion` which allows the "creation" function
      to be called asynchronously or be subsituted for
      another asynchronous creation scheme.  Courtesy

        :pullreq: 9

      The function decorated by :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_on_arguments`
      now includes a ``set()`` method, in addition to the existing
      ``invalidate()`` method.   Like ``invalidate()``, it accepts
      a set of function arguments, but additionally accepts as the
      first positional argument a new value to place in the cache,
      to take the place of that key.  Courtesy Antoine Bertin.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug
        :tickets: 15

      Fixed bug in DBM backend whereby if an error occurred
      during the "write" operation, the file lock, if enabled,
      would not be released, thereby deadlocking the app.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug
        :tickets: 12

      The :func:`.util.function_key_generator` used by the
      function decorator no longer coerces non-unicode
      arguments into a Python unicode object on Python 2.x;
      this causes failures on backends such as DBM which
      on Python 2.x apparently require bytestrings.  The
      key_mangler is still needed if actual unicode arguments
      are being used by the decorated function, however.

      DBM backend has "fallback" when calling dbm.get() to
      instead use dictionary access + KeyError, in the case
      that the "gdbm" backend is used which does not include
      .get().  Courtesy Jon Rosebaugh.

      Using dogpile.core 0.4.0 now, fixes a critical
      bug whereby dogpile pileup could occur on first value
      get across multiple processes, due to reliance upon
      a non-shared creation time.  This is a dogpile.core
      issue.

      Added support to DBM file lock to allow reentrant
      access per key within a single thread, so that

      a creation function that calls upon a different
      key in the cache can still proceed.
